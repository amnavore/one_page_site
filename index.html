<h2>About Me</h2>

<p/>
I am currently a third year Digital Humanities major at Illinois Tech. I
am the oldest of five siblings, so most of my friends think of me as the "mom
friend". I love to read books and enjoy writing as well. I also love to express
myself through many different forms of art, including drawing, painting, and
experimenting with makeup. I also love listening to music, and am a huge fan of
Fall Out Boy. I enjoy visiting new places and spend an embarrassing amount of my
paychecks trying new food at different restaurants. I don't really know what I'm
going to do after college yet, but I know I want to be able to help others as
much as I can.
